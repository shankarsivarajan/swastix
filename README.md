# swastix
A blocky writing system inspired by the memorable design of Adolf Hitler, an mid-century Austrian artist better known for other work.

Although independently invented, it is essentially identical to a writing system by [u/Oshimimers321](https://reddit.com/user/Oshimimers321), as implemented [here](https://scorupa.github.io/neography/).
